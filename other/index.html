        <h1>11/20 <a href="https://github.com/nocturnll/sleuth">Sleuth</a>, an open source tool for reading Slack logs</h1><p>
            originally built by Felix for reading desktop logs, but then I learned <span class="lang">typescript</span> and added mobile log support.<br>
            mainly for those of us in support who, up until then, had to read mobile logs in a text editor-<br>
            but it ended up helping the mobile QA engineers, so that's neat. also it's an <span class="lang">electron</span> app.</p><p>

        <h1>9/20 <a href="https://github.com/nocturnll/loot-roller">Loot roller</a>, a custom diceroll bot for a tabletop rpg campaign</h1><p>
            built at first as a CLI app with <span class="lang">node.js</span>, then ported as a <span class="lang">discord bot</span>.<br>
            the loot logic in this campaign was pretty complicated. this bot saved us literal hours.<p>

            </p>
        </p>
        <h1>5/20 <a href="../weather/">Holistic weather</a>, a forecast app for random cities</h1><p>
            built in <span class="lang">react</span> as more of a virtual newspaper art project than a functional app.<br>
            if you want to get pretentious about it: it lets you travel the world in a uniquely immersive way.<br>
            <p><img src="weather.png"></p>
        </p>
        <h1>5/20 <span class="no_a_title">Pacecar & pacecar builder</span>, an unfinished choose-your-own-adventure racing game</h1><p>
            both made with <span class="lang">javascript</span>. the builder takes the script for a page, and generates code that I can paste into the Pacecar app.<br>
            the game would have been neat if I finished it, but it turns out I was more interested in coding it than writing a narrative.<br>
            (you don't get to see the code because it's gross. sorry.)</p><p>

        <h1>5/20 <a href="../snek">Snek</a>, a basic snake game</h1><p>
            written in <span class="lang">HTML</span>. has a power-up/debuff mechanic for extra funsies.<br>
            </p><p>

        <h1>5/20 <a href="../ohno">Oh no</a>, for when you feel like spiraling</h1><p>
            the first project that I wasn't told to make. made with <span class="lang">HTML</span> and <span class="lang">CSS</span>.<br>
            </p><p>
