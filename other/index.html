        <h1><a href="https://github.com/nocturnll/sleuth">Sleuth</a>, an open source tool for reading Slack logs</h1><p></p>
            originally built by Felix for reading desktop logs, but then I learned typescript and added mobile log support.<br>
            mainly for those of us in support who, up until then, had to read mobile logs in a text editor-<br>
            but it ended up helping the mobile QA engineers, so that's neat.<p>

        <h1><a href="https://github.com/nocturnll/loot-roller">loot roller</a>, a custom diceroll bot for a tabletop rpg campaign</h1><p>
            built at first as a CLI app with node, then ported as a discord bot.<br>
            the loot logic in this campaign was pretty complicated and looting took 20+ minutes per fight.<p>

        <h1><span class="no_a_title">Pacecar & pacecar-builder</span>, an unfinished choose-your-own-adventure racing game</h1><p>
            the builder tool was made in js: it takes the script for a page, and generates code that I can paste into the Pacecar app.<br>
            the game would have been neat if I finished it, but it turns out I was more interested in coding it than writing a narrative.<br>
            you don't get to see the code because it's gross. sorry.<p>
